  Challenging Action Games
Action games involve overcoming challenges, often physically. Thereâ€™s usually an element of reaction time and hand-eye coordination, so you need to think fast to perform well in the game.

  Some action games add a layer of problem-solving to these basic elements with difficult challenges and puzzles. Games like 1v1 Battle and Jacksmith require quick-thinking, great technique, and coordination to get through increasingly complex level structures that are riddled with deadly traps.

  Other action games are less about the challenge, and more about casual fun, like Cuphead and Duck Life.
